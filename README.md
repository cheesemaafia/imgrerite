- On Linux/MacOS

## FAQs

### But where does my resulting images get stored?

In your system's home directory, there would be a new folder now, named Imgrerite, all the images are saved there. By reverse revealing those images, you'll see the text you hid

### And what are the limitations to this tool?

You can only enter texts for now and that too without a new line, I know it sucks!
I'll improve this in the future, so that a whole text file can be hidden inside an image rather than manually typing the text 

And well, let me tell you a secret, this does not really hide stuff, I mean anyone can use this tool to read those hidden texts, right?
I'm planning to next implement a mechanism that solves this

### Okay, but why? WHY?

I was bored

### I need help in installation? / Provide Feedback / Meh! Just wanna say 'Hi!'
