## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Git 

Most of the Linux and MacOS systems comes pre-installed with Python and Git, unfortunately this is not true for Windows. But, they can be downloaded manually from [(Python)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [(Git)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Just make sure they are added to PATH

## Installation 

In your preferred terminal (recommended to use Powershell/Windows Terminal for Windows), run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cheesemaafia/Imgrerite.git
```
This will install Imgrerite to your system

## Usage

After installation, run

- On Linux/MacOS
```sh
cd Imgrerite
python3 imgrerite.py
```
- On Windows
```sh
cd Imgrerite
py imgrerite.py
```
From here on, the program will guide you

## FAQs

### But where does my resulting images get stored?

On your system, there would be a new folder/directory now, named Imgrerite, all the images are saved there. By reverse revealing those images, you'll see the text you hid :)

### And what are the limitations to this tool?

You can only enter texts for now and that too without a new line, I know it sucks!
I'll improve this in future, so that a whole text file can be hidden inside an image rather than manually typing the text 

And well, let me tell you a secret, this does not really hides stuff, I mean anyone can use this tool to read those hidden texts, right?
I'm planning to next implement a mechanism that solves this

### Okay, but why? WHY?

I was bored

### I need help in installation?/Provide Feedback/Meh! Just wanna say 'Hi!'
