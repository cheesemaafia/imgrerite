# ImagickCLI

A command line tool to hide and reveal information inside images (works for both PNGs and JPGs)

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Git 

Most of the Linux and MacOS systems comes pre-installed with Python and Git, unfortunately this is not true for Windows. But, they can be downloaded manually from [(Python)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [(Git)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Just make sure they are added to PATH

## Installation 

In your preferred terminal (recommended to use Git Bash for Windows), run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cheesemaafia/ImagickCLI.git && cd ImagickCLI
```
This will install ImagickCLI to your system

## Usage

After installation, run

- On Linux/MacOS
```sh
python3 imagick.py
```
- On Windows
```sh
py imagick.py
```
From here on, the program will guide you

## But where does my resulting images get stored?

On your system, there would be a new folder/directory now, named ImagickCLI, all the images are saved there :)

## And what are the limitations to this tool?

You can only enter texts for now and that too without a new line, I know it sucks!
I'll improve this in future, so that a whole text file can be hidden inside an image rather than manually typing the text 

## Okay, but why? WHY?

I was bored 

## Need help in installation?/Provide Feedback/Meh! Just wanna say 'Hi!'
